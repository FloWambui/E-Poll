          E-Poll is an online voting system that allows groups of people to
          securely conduct votes and elections. High-quality online voting
          systems balance ballot security, accessibility, and the overall
          requirements of an organization's voting event.

          This is a Simple,secure and transparent voting system. With our lives
          increasingly shifting online, it’s only logical that voting would
          transition to a digital platform, too. Common features include
          single-vote verification, which ensures members don’t inadvertently
          vote more than once; ballot tracking, which monitors the exact moment
          a ballot is processed; a secure network to protect the entire process
          from nominations to tabulation; and secret ballots, which keep ballots
          private.
